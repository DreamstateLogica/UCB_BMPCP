--- Redox Potential Calculation Summary ---
Timestamp: 2025-07-15 09:40:33
Calculation Mode: reduction
Energy Type Used for Delta: Gibbs (Runs Freq!)
Optional ORCA Keywords: TightSCF=True, SlowConv=True
Using Solvation Model: CPCM(methanol)
Using reference potential for SCE in methanol: E_ref=-0.210 V vs SHE

Total processing time: 12686.03 seconds

--- Overall Results ---
No oxidation potentials were successfully calculated and referenced.
Molecule most easily REDUCED (Highest E_red): O=C(NOC(C1=CC=C(Br)C=C1)=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 (-1.764 V vs SCE in methanol)

--- Detailed Results ---
* Potentials calculated using Delta Gibbs and Literature Formula: E = - (E_N - E_Ion) / F - E_abs_SHE - E_ref_vs_SHE
* Frequency calculation performed on required states for minimum validation.
* Reference Electrode: vs SCE in methanol (E_abs_SHE=4.281V, E_ref=-0.210V)
* WARNING: Ensure values in SCE_REF_POTENTIALS_VS_SHE dictionary are accurate and appropriate!
